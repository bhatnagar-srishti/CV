        So this  is where is all began! I've always loved multimedia and computers more than anything. I could sit in a computer lab more than in a playground. Well, not a fantastic topper but interest and knowledge is everything you ever need.

          <li>Basically, after boards, every kid gets a 2 month break to figure out what they wanna do with their life? Some brilliant minds have it all planned, some just go with the flow. I wanted to learn about everything! I decided to take my love for learning more about basic 'computers'  further with a field where we can learn about everything, which in fact answers a very important question. I am inclined more towards UX, than UI. I'd love to learn more about it.</li>
